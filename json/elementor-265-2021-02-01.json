The dress code&nbsp;requires gents to wear a tuxedo, which can also be called a&nbsp;dinner suit. Unlike a standard suit, a tuxedo features contrasting lapels, which can be peak or shawl style, and a side stripe down the outseam of the pants. Ideally, your tux should be black or midnight blue and partnered with a white, formal shirt. Complete your look with a black bow tie, or one that matches the facing of your tuxedo, and smart&nbsp;dress shoes, such as black Oxfords. You may also want to wear a black waistcoat or cummerbund to add interest and further polish to your appearance.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":137,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/191.4e9.myftpupload.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Screenshot_20210130_144141.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-137\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"}]}
