Ladies, it\u2019s time to get out your best floor-length gowns. This is as luxe as it gets, in fact, most black tie events don\u2019t allow cocktail-length dresses or suits without jackets and ties.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What can I wear to a Black Tie Event?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A full-length gown is a must for the ladies at a black tie function. If you\u2019re going to risk going shorter, keep it below the knee and make sure your dress is well-designed and something along the lines of Alex Perry\u2019s version below. Pair your look with some exquisite jewellery, considered makeup and hair, and a killer pair of heels. However, a black-tie event is an opportunity to break out your fanciest full-length gown, so why wouldn\u2019t you?
