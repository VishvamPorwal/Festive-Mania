To correctly dress for this style of attire, aim for an appearance that\u2019s more elevated than your usual casual wear yet still relaxed and comfortable. You can do so by combining everyday garments with more sophisticated items. Of course, precisely how you interpret this dress code is up to you. You may want to wear&nbsp;jeans&nbsp;with a&nbsp;T-shirt&nbsp;and&nbsp;blazer&nbsp;or&nbsp;chinos&nbsp;with a chambray shirt. The choice is yours. Just make sure you strike the right balance of smart and casual, and that you\u2019re dressed appropriately for the event you\u2019re attending.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":101,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/191.4e9.myftpupload.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Smart-Casual-Men.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-101\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"}]}
