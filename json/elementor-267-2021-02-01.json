It sits a notch above cocktail attire and just below the&nbsp;black tie. As such it demands a look that is classically sophisticated yet also somewhat contemporary. Like cocktail attire, a suit makes a better choice than a tuxedo for a semi formal event. However, you should be sure to maintain a polished appearance for semi-formal functions.
