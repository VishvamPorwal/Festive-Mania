To nail the code, you\u2019ll need to dress to the nines. That means dialing things up even further than your sleek,&nbsp;black tie&nbsp;tux. To do so, you\u2019ll need to wear a black tuxedo with tails, a white tuxedo shirt, such as a pleated or bib-front design, a white waistcoat, a white bow tie, and black, patent leather dress shoes. If you don\u2019t already own these items and are not one to attend white tie events regularly, you can consider hiring them. Additionally, if you want to add more flash to your outfit, you can also wear white gloves and a black top hat. However, these items aren\u2019t necessary.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":180,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/191.4e9.myftpupload.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/White-Tie-Dress-Code-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-180\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"}]}
