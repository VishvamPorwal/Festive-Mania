In particular, the main difference between these two smart yet relaxed codes is that business casual must also project an air of professionalism. Often called upon for modern offices, business casual attire doesn\u2019t require a suit. Instead, a less formal outfit, such as&nbsp;chinos&nbsp;with a sweater or&nbsp;dark jeans&nbsp;with a&nbsp;blazer, works perfectly. When it comes to selecting a shirt, choose a style that\u2019s ideal for the office, such as a classic colored&nbsp;Oxford&nbsp;or checkered button-down. Complete your outfit with smart footwear like&nbsp;brogues,&nbsp;monk-straps,&nbsp;loafers, or&nbsp;Derby shoes&nbsp;in suede or matte leather.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":104,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/191.4e9.myftpupload.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Business-Casual-Dress-Code.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-104\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->"},"elements":[],"isInner":false,"widgetType":"text-editor","elType":"widget"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"column"}],"isInner":false,"elType":"section"}]}
